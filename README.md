# Ranagade
*Entry for Global Game Jam 2024 - Make Me Laugh*

## Intro
Here comes a friendly simple frog, who is an hero escaping a fancy dungeon with fancy people. 
This frog is also a mistreated waiter who must complete their work schedule in a fast-food in order to face a raged dragon. 
Sounds odd? Perhaps it'll make you laugh!

## Description
This game was created during GGJ2024 at SteamFactory - Pisa, then fine tuned and published on itch.io for fun!

You can play the original jam version here.

In this adventure game, you play as a frog that must traverse two levels to reach the final boss. 
A portal is present on each level and it must be opened by finding a key or completing a task.
